Plan of ATTACK:

Major components that need to be rebuilt for FDN4:

	NAVBAR -- OKAY, it's working.  Now get everythign else working and come back.

	TABS

	ORBIT -- Create new CPT.  Use LI based layout for slides.  Make all images 4:3. Pull [title] [featured image] [content]. Eventually change to custom fields.  OKAY, it's working.  Get everything else working and come back to configure.

NEW PLAN:
	x  Move menu bar to top of site, fixed.  
	x Style wrapper.
	x Add full-width orbit slideshow.
		DECISION TIME.............
			do we stick with WP Events Manager or migrate to Event Espresso?
			WPEM may be simpler and better suited to novice editors.
			EE is more powerful but quirkier.
			Doubtful they will be trying to sell tickets, but it's possible with tradcamp. 
			Plugin needs to have featured image. both do.
			Plugin needs to support WP queries. EE does indirectly. WPEM can do something similar, but not via custom post types.
				OR DOES IT? We might want a separate Rotator function anyway. It may be too much to ask people to editorialize events and decide which one to feature.
				TRY setting up the WPEM to do this. If it doesn't work, we'll move elsewhere. better to know before we get too far.
		Grab some new content for this.
